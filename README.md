# Supermarket Sales Analysis

The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities is increasing, and market competitions are also high. This project presents an analysis of historical sales data from a supermarket company that was recorded in three different branches over a three-month period. Predictive data analytics methods are applied to gain insights from the dataset.

## About the Dataset

The dataset provides historical sales data from a supermarket company, covering a three-month period. It includes information about different branches, sales transactions, customer details, and product categories. The dataset can be used for various business and data analysis purposes, including sales trend analysis, customer behavior insights, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

This project is aimed at leveraging the dataset to gain valuable insights and perform predictive data analytics. Here's a brief overview of what the project includes:

- Data preprocessing, including cleaning and feature engineering.
- Application of linear regression models for predictive analysis.
- Detailed analysis of the linear regression model using the Ordinary Least Squares method.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sales trends and customer behavior.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis. It involves tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering. In this project, the dataset has been prepared for analysis.

## Linear Regression Analysis

A linear regression model is applied to predict sales quantity based on various features in the dataset. The model is trained, and predictions are made for further analysis.

## Ordinary Least Squares Regression Model

The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model is used to analyze the linear regression model's performance in detail. This includes variable names, coefficients, and model statistics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA provides insights into the dataset and helps in understanding key patterns and trends. In this project, we perform EDA to discover:

- Best-selling products
- Best-selling months
- Most used payment methods
- Total sales by customer type
- Total sales by gender
- Most rated branch
- Most patronized time of the day
- Best selling day of the week
